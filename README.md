Old Version:

0.x version, latest version 0.3.12 (traditional version, improved based
on [vue-code-diff](https://github.com/ddchef/vue-code-diff), is no longer maintained. We will try to align the
functionality of 0.x version in 1.x version and minimize migration cost as much as possible).
This project references the following projects, and I would like to express my gratitude to the original authors!

* [vue-diff](https://github.com/hoiheart/vue-diff)
* [vue-code-diff](https://github.com/ddchef/vue-code-diff)

## Extend languages

In order to reduce the size of the packaged file, the system only supports the following commonly used languages by
default.

* plaintext
* xml/html
* javascript
* json
* yaml
* python
* java
* bash
* sql

If the language you need is not included, you can manually import the relevant language highlighting module.

```shell
pnpm add highlight.js
```

```typescript
import CodeDiff from 'v-code-diff';
// Extend C language
import c from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/c';

CodeDiff.hljs.registerLanguage('c', c);
```

## Migrate from 0.x version

The v-code-diff 1.x version has features such as reduced packaging size and improved performance compared to the 0.x
version. And we will try to align the functions with the 0.x version as much as possible to reduce your migration cost.

Key points:

* In the 1.x version, language recognition and highlighting will no longer be automatically performed, you need to
  manually specify the language type, such as language="python", if not specified, it will default to plaintext
  and will not be highlighted.
* In the 1.x version, due to the fact that rendering and highlighting are performed at the same time, the component
  events
  have been removed.
* In the 1.x version, the following component properties (Prop) have been changed:
  * highlight - removed
  * drawFileList - removed
  * fileName - rename to "filename"

Below is a detailed comparison of the two versions, you can refer to it to complete the migration.

### The difference of event.

The component events are no longer provided in the 1.x version as rendering and highlighting are carried out
simultaneously.

| Event Name    | Change Status      |
|---------------|--------------------|
| before-render | No longer provided |
| after-render  | No longer provided |

### The difference of prop.

| Prop                   | Description                                                                 | Change Status                                   |

| isShowNoChange         | Display source code when there is no comparison                             | Removed as it became the default in version 1.x |
